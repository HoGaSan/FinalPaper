### Rationale for Inclusion / Exclusion

TODO

<!--
Deciding on the data that will be used for the analysis is based on several criteria, including its relevance to the data mining goals, as well as quality and technical constraints such as limits on data volume or data types. For instance, while an individualâ€™s address may be used to determine which region that individual is from, the actual street address data can likely be eliminated to reduce the amount of data that must be evaluated. Part of the data selection process should involve explaining why certain data was included or excluded. It is also a good idea to decide if one or more attributes are more important than others are.
