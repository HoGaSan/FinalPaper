### Merged Data

TODO

<!--
Integrating data involves combining information from multiple tables or records to create new records or values. With table-based data, an analyst can join two or more tables that have different information about the same objects. For instance, a retail chain has one table with information about each store’s general characteristics (e.g., floor space, type of mall), another table with summarized sales data (e.g., profit, percent change in sales from previous year), and another table with information about the demographics of the surrounding area. Each of these tables contains one record for each store. These tables can be merged together into a new table with one record for each store, combining fields from the source tables.
Data integration also covers aggregations. Aggregations refer to operations where new values are computed by summarizing information from multiple records and/or tables. For example, an aggregation could include converting a table of customer purchases, where there is one record for each purchase, into a new table where there is one record for each customer. The table’s fields could include the number of purchases, the average purchase amount, the percent of orders charged to credit cards, the percent of items under promotion, etc.
