### Merged Data

The business objectives are defining two main goals for the project, namely:

1. Create a statistical analysis to identify those reasons (based on the data available), which are determining the the risk of an animal strike for an airport.
2. Create a prediction model, which can be used to predict the risk of an animal strike for a given flight.

Realizing these objectives I need to merge the data sets based on two very different set of criteria, while I have to take into account the impact of the merge on the final results.

Criteria set for merging the data regarding the first business goal:

* Base data set to be used is the Federal Aviation Administration Airport Data & Contact Information
* Use airports having flight data available (both as an origin and as a destination airport) in the data set obtained from the United States Department of Transportation
* Enrich the data with the animal strike data acquired from the Federal Aviation Administration Wildlife Strike Database

There are multiple different ways of uniquely identifying an airport. In the US one option is to use the Federal Aviation Administration Location ID, while another way is to use the international airport code of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The data sets are using a mix of these identifiers.

\textit{Note: The airports might have identification code from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and/or the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and/or Federal Aviation Administration (FAA LID). Some airports have identification codes from all these organizations, some does not. The data acquired from the agencies are using codes from two of the identification code types.}

Based on the merged data I can visualize the distribution of the animal strikes in the map of the US.

Criteria set for merging the data regarding the second business goal:

* Base data set to be used is the available in the data set obtained from the United States Department of Transportation
* Marking the flight data with the animal strike information should be based on the following list of criteria:
    + airline / carrier
    + incident date
    + airport and state
    + flight number

Notes:

* The Federal Aviation Administration Wildlife Strike Database is based on the geographical location of the strike. The database contains the strike records regardless of the airline / carrier, meaning that it contain the strike data of international flights as well.
* The flight performance data from the United States Department of Transportation contains the data only from the major airlines.

The strict criteria for integrating the two main data sets resulted the following actual number of identified strikes in the flight performance data:

|Number of flight records |Number of striked records |Percentage |
|:------------------------|:-------------------------|:----------|
|155,432,729|28,740|0.01849%|
