### Data Quality Report


#### Animal strike data

The data set provided by the Federal Aviation Administration is a data set based on voluntary strike reporting from airlines, airports, pilots, and other sources. Therefore the quality of the data enormously depends on the goodwill of the reporting source and even with the best intentions there are several quality issues which needs to be addressed later in the project.

* Mixed use of uppercase and lowercase letters/codes
* Mixed use of codes (e.g.: engine type is defined as "A/C")
* Number of States in the data set is above the actual number of states in the U.S.

The Federal Aviation Administration provides code books for some of the data details in the strike reports. Based on these code books the records with the following values can be removed from the data set, as they are not relevant for the goals of the project.


| Column name | Value | Reason for removal                             |
|:------------|:------|:-----------------------------------------------|
|OPID|"PVT"|Record is related of a strike to a privately owned aircraft, not to an aircraft operated by a commercial airline.|
|OPID|"BUS"|Record is related of a strike to a business aircraft, not to an aircraft operated by a commercial airline.|
|OPID|"GOV"|Record is related of a strike to a government aircraft, not to an aircraft operated by a commercial airline.|
|OPID|"MIL"|Record is related of a strike to a military aircraft, not to an aircraft operated by a commercial airline.|
|OPID|"UNKC"|Record is related of a strike to an aircraft of an unknown commercial operator. Without this information identification of the flight can't be done correctly.|
|OPID|"UNK"|Record is related of a strike to an aircraft of an unknown operator. Without this information identification of the flight can't be done correctly.|
|AC_CLASS|"B"|Value stands for helicopter.|
|AC_CLASS|"C"|Value stands for glider.|
|AC_CLASS|"D"|Value stands for balloon.|
|AC_CLASS|"F"|Value stands for dirigible.|
|AC_CLASS|"I"|Value stands for gyroplane.|
|AC_CLASS|"J"|Value stands for ultralight.|
|AC_CLASS|"Y"|Value stands for other.|
|AC_CLASS|"Z"|Value stands for unknown.|
|AC_CLASS|""|Value is empty.|
|TYPE_ENG|"E"|Value stands for none (glider).|
|TYPE_ENG|"F"|Value stands for turboshaft (helicopter).|
|TYPE_ENG|""|Value is empty.|


The strike report itself contains a great deal of details, which can be used in different projects, but for our purposes the following details have to be removed to concentrate on those information, which we expect to be the cause and not the effect of the strike. The following details needs to be removed from the data set in a later stage.

#### Flight data


TODO

<!--
At this point, the analyst examines the quality of the data, addressing questions such as: Is the data complete? Missing values often occur, particularly if the data was collected across long periods of time. Some common items to check include: missing attributes and blank fields; whether all possible values are represented; the plausibility of values; the spelling of values; and whether attributes with different values have similar meanings (e.g., low fat, diet). The data analyst also should review any attributes that may give answers that conflict with common sense (e.g., teenagers with high income).
