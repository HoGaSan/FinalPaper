### Data Quality Report


#### Animal strike data

The data set provided by the Federal Aviation Administration is a data set based on voluntary strike reporting from airlines, airports, pilots, and other sources. Therefore the quality of the data enormously depends on the goodwill of the reporting source and even with the best intentions there are several quality issues which needs to be addressed later in the project.

* Mixed use of uppercase and lowercase letters/codes
* Mixed use of codes (e.g.: engine type is defined as "A/C")
* Number of States in the data set is above the actual number of states of the U.S.

The Federal Aviation Administration provides code books for some of the data details in the strike reports. Based on these code books the records with the following values can be removed from the data set, as they are not relevant for the goals of the project.


| Column name | Value | Reason for removal                             |
|:------------|:------|:-----------------------------------------------|
|OPID|"PVT"|Record is related of a strike to a privately owned aircraft, not to an aircraft operated by a commercial airline.|
|OPID|"BUS"|Record is related of a strike to a business aircraft, not to an aircraft operated by a commercial airline.|
|OPID|"GOV"|Record is related of a strike to a government aircraft, not to an aircraft operated by a commercial airline.|
|OPID|"MIL"|Record is related of a strike to a military aircraft, not to an aircraft operated by a commercial airline.|
|OPID|"UNKC"|Record is related of a strike to an aircraft of an unknown commercial operator. Without this information identification of the flight can't be done correctly.|
|OPID|"UNK"|Record is related of a strike to an aircraft of an unknown operator. Without this information identification of the flight can't be done correctly.|
|AC_CLASS|"B"|Value stands for helicopter.|
|AC_CLASS|"C"|Value stands for glider.|
|AC_CLASS|"D"|Value stands for balloon.|
|AC_CLASS|"F"|Value stands for dirigible.|
|AC_CLASS|"I"|Value stands for gyroplane.|
|AC_CLASS|"J"|Value stands for ultralight.|
|AC_CLASS|"Y"|Value stands for other.|
|AC_CLASS|"Z"|Value stands for unknown.|
|AC_CLASS|""|Value is empty.|

|TYPE_ENG|""|Value is empty.|


The strike report itself contains a great deal of details, which can be used in different projects, but for our purposes the following details have to be removed to concentrate on those information, which we expect to be the cause and not the effect of the strike. The following details needs to be removed from the data set in a later stage.

#### Flight data

The data set provided by the United States Department of Transportation is a data set based on the timetable and the actual flight information collected by various systems. Therefore the quality of the data is significantly better than the data from the Federal Aviation Administration Animal Strike Database, but there are still some possible quality issues which needs to be addressed later in the project after further investigation. These issues include:

* Number of States in the data set is above the actual number of states of the U.S.

The data in the Federal Aviation Administration Animal Strike Database is available only until 30-4-2016, so the flight data needs to be adjusted accordingly.

Similarly to the Federal Aviation Administration Animal Strike Database, the flight performance data set contains a great deal of details as well, which can be used in different projects, but for our purposes the following details have to be removed to concentrate on those information, which we expect to be the cause and not the effect of the strike. The following details needs to be removed from the data set in a later stage.
