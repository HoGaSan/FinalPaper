### Final Report

As already mentioned in the initial resource plan, this final paper is a pet project without real business stakeholders, therefore the results of the project will never be put into a real production environment, meaning that beyond the creation of this final paper and the expected presentation of the results of the project no additional reports are going to be created.


### Final Presentation

TODO

<!--
At the end of the project, the project leader and his or her team write up a final report. Depending on the deployment plan, this report may be only a summary of the project and its experiences (if they have not already been documented as an ongoing activity) or it may be a final and comprehensive presentation of the data mining result(s). This report includes all of the previous deliverables and summarizes and organizes the results. Also, there often will be a meeting at the conclusion of the project, where the results are verbally presented to the customer.
