### Test Design

The most efficient way of assessing the model would be to use a subset of the data set which was not used for training and for testing the model during the model building. Therefore I've split the data set to three sub-sets, containing 60% of the records for the training, 20% of the records for validating the model during the model building and 20% of the records for scoring the built model.
