### Parameter Settings

The R language provides quite a lot of possibilities for setting different parameters for the linear regression models. Keeping the modelling as simple as possible I'm using the default settings for the linear model fitting.

### Models

Before building any model I checked the type and in the relevant cases the distribution of the variables (for the outcome and for the predictor variables as well). The following table shows the type of the variables I've used in the model building:

| Variable name   | Type of the variable | Modelling relevance | Check distribution |
|:----------------|:---------------------|:--------------------|:-------------------|
|StrikeNo|Number|Outcome|Yes|
|Region|Categorical|Predictor|No|
|State|Categorical|Predictor|No|
|OriginCount|Integer|Predictor|Yes|
|OriginMaxDistance|Number|Predictor|Yes|
|OriginMinDistance|Number|Predictor|Yes|
|OriginAvgDistance|Number|Predictor|Yes|
|DestinationCount|Integer|Predictor|Yes|
|DestinationMaxDistance|Number|Predictor|Yes|
|DestinationMinDistance|Number|Predictor|Yes|
|DestinationAvgDistance|Number|Predictor|Yes|
|ARPElevation|Integer|Predictor|Yes|
|LandAreaCoveredByAirport|Number|Predictor|Yes|

Checking the histograms of the relevant fields I saw that none of the fields have a normal distribution, instead all of them are left-skewed.

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{center}

\includegraphics[height=60mm]{Histogram_of_StrikeNo}
\includegraphics[height=60mm]{Histogram_of_OriginCount}
\includegraphics[height=60mm]{Histogram_of_OriginMinDistance}
\includegraphics[height=60mm]{Histogram_of_OriginMaxDistance}
\includegraphics[height=60mm]{Histogram_of_OriginAvgDistance}
\includegraphics[height=60mm]{Histogram_of_DestinationCount}
\includegraphics[height=60mm]{Histogram_of_DestinationMinDistance}
\includegraphics[height=60mm]{Histogram_of_DestinationMaxDistance}
\includegraphics[height=60mm]{Histogram_of_DestinationAvgDistance}
\includegraphics[height=60mm]{Histogram_of_ARPElevation}
\includegraphics[height=60mm]{Histogram_of_LandAreaCoveredByAirport}

\end{center}
\end{multicols}

Resolving this issue can be done using the log of these fields, which will normalize the distributions as it is shown below.

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{center}

\includegraphics[height=60mm]{Histogram_of_log_StrikeNo}
\includegraphics[height=60mm]{Histogram_of_log_OriginCount}
\includegraphics[height=60mm]{Histogram_of_log_OriginMinDistance}
\includegraphics[height=60mm]{Histogram_of_log_OriginMaxDistance}
\includegraphics[height=60mm]{Histogram_of_log_OriginAvgDistance}
\includegraphics[height=60mm]{Histogram_of_log_DestinationCount}
\includegraphics[height=60mm]{Histogram_of_log_DestinationMinDistance}
\includegraphics[height=60mm]{Histogram_of_log_DestinationMaxDistance}
\includegraphics[height=60mm]{Histogram_of_log_DestinationAvgDistance}
\includegraphics[height=60mm]{Histogram_of_log_ARPElevation}
\includegraphics[height=60mm]{Histogram_of_log_LandAreaCoveredByAirport}

\end{center}
\end{multicols}

Taking into account several combinations I've built the following models.

| Model name   | Predictors                      |
|:-------------|:--------------------------------|
|Model01-01|OriginCount, DestinationCount|
|Model01-02|OriginCount, OriginMaxDistance, OriginMinDistance, OriginAvgDistance, DestinationCount, DestinationMaxDistance, DestinationMinDistance, DestinationAvgDistance|
|Model01-03|ARPElevation, LandAreaCoveredByAirport|
|Model01-04|Region|
|Model01-05|Region, State|
|Model01-06|State, OriginCount, DestinationCount, ARPElevation, LandAreaCoveredByAirport|


### Model Description

The first model (**Model01-01**) is built based on the assumption that the traffic generated by the airport has a significant impact on the number of animal strike on the given airport.

The second model (**Model01-02**) is an extension of the first model, since it contains data about the flights of the airport using the assumption that a longer distance requires a bigger airplane as well.

The third model (**Model01-03**) is taking into account only airport related details, namely the elevation of the airport above the see level and the land occupied by the airport.

The fourth model (**Model01-04**) is based on only the FAA regions and with the fifth model (**Model01-05**) they cover the possibilities from the airport location point of view (up to a reasonable level).

The sixth and last model (**Model01-06**) is combining the most predictors being evaluated as most significant ones from the previous models.
