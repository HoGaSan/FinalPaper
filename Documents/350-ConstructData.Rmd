### Derived Attributes

TODO

### Generated Records

TODO


<!--
After the data is cleaned, the data analyst should undertake data preparation operations such as developing entirely new records or producing derived attributes. An example of a new record would be the creation of an empty purchase record for customers who made no purchases during the past year. Derived attributes, in contrast, are new attributes that are constructed from existing attributes, such as Area = Length x Width. These derived attributes should only be added if they ease the model process or facilitate the modeling algorithm, not just to reduce the number of input attributes. For instance, perhaps “income per head” is a better/easier attribute to use than “income per household.” Another type of derived attribute is single-attribute transformations, usually performed to fit the needs of the modeling tools. These transformations may be necessary to transform ranges to symbolic fields (e.g., ages to age bands), or symbolic fields (“definitely yes,” “yes,” “don’t know,” “no”) to numeric values. Modeling tools or algorithms often require these transformations.
