### Reformatted Data

TODO

<!--
In some cases, the data analyst will change the format or design of the data. These changes might be simple—for example, removing illegal characters from strings or trimming them to a maximum length—or they may be more complex, such as those involving a reorganization of the information. Sometimes these changes are needed to make the data suitable for a specific modeling tool. In other instances, the changes are needed to pose the necessary data mining questions.
