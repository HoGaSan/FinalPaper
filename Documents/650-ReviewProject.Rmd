### Experience Documentation

TODO

<!--
The data analyst should assess failures and successes as well as potential areas of improvement for use in future projects. This step should include a summary of important experiences during the project and can include interviews with the significant project participants. This document could include pitfalls, misleading approaches, or hints for selecting the best-suited data mining techniques in similar situations. In ideal projects, experience documentation also covers any reports written by individual project members during the project phases and tasks.
