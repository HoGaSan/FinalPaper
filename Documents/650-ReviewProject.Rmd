### Experience Documentation

The most remarkable remark is, that the use of the CRISP-DM process model helps covering all the aspects with ease of a data mining engagement. but of course there were several less significant observations as well, like:

* The quality of the date is rather bad in case it's based on voluntary manual reporting.
* The integration of different data sources might be more complex than the cleaning and exploring those data sets involved.
* Having data from goverment agencies (even if it's the same agency, but different office) can have notable quality differences.
* Using open source and freely available tools (including model building platforms as well) can give you the false sence of security when it comes to code quality (and hidden bugs).
* Never-ever underestimate the amunt of work required to clean, format and integrate the data.
