# Introduction

The structure of the document follows the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) process model, which is a non-proprietary, documented, and freely available data mining model [@shearer2000]. Whenever the model sections can be matched to (and can fulfill) the requirements stated by CEU for the Final Paper I'm using the appropiate section identified by the CRIPS-DM model. Please keep in mind that the model supports the full end-to-end process of a data mining project, but the project does not require the use of all the model elements.


# Business understanding

## Determine Business Objectives

### Business Objectives

\color{red}**TODO**\color{black}

### Business Success Criteria
* Identification of featured determining the risk potential of an airport
* Working model for animal strike prediction

## Assess Situation

### Inventory of resources
* Flight Data
* Animal Strike Data
* R
* Buckets

### Requirements, Assumptions, and Constraints

### Risks and Contingencies
* No initial Risks identified
* No initial Contingencies identified

### Terminology

\color{red}**TODO**\color{black}


### Costs and Benefits
This is a one-man project, no significant cost is expected. Main benefit is to put to and almost end-to-end scenario the topics covered during the courses and discovering bits and bolts of the techniques for creating the project. 

## Determine Data Mining Goals

### Data Mining Goals
* Understand, Analyse, Clean and Merge the source data correctly
* Create the required attributes
* Generate the required records (if applicable)

### Data Mining Success Criteria
* Identification of featured determining the risk potential of an airport
* Working model for animal strike prediction

## Produce Project Plan

### Project Plan
The project is managed in an agile way, where all the tasks, requirements, issues, solutions, and ideas are kept in a project at [buckets](https://www.buckets.co/).

### Initial Assessment of Tools and Techniques
* Programming language:
    + [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
* GUI for the programming language:
    + [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)
* Documentation (including this initial project description) is created using:
    + [knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/)
    + [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/)
    + [ReporteRs](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ReporteRs/index.html)
* Data visualisation:
    + [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/)
* Data manipulation:
    + [access2csv](https://github.com/AccelerationNet/access2csv)
    + [dtplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dtplyr/index.html)
* Project plan / task management:
    + [Buckets](https://www.buckets.co/)
* Source code repository:
    + [GitHub](https://github.com/)
