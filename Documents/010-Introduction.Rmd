The structure of the document follows the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) process model, which is a non-proprietary, documented, and freely available data mining model [@shearer2000]. Whenever the model sections can be matched to (and can fulfill) the requirements stated by CEU for the Final Paper I'm using the appropriate section identified by the CRIPS-DM model. Please keep in mind that the model supports the full end-to-end process of a data mining project, but the project does not require the use of all the model elements.
