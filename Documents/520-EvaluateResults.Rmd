### Assessment of Data Mining Result with Business Success Criteria

The regressions and the models built and assessed shows that even with a quite limited and noisy data some level or certainty can be reached, but all these results needs to be used with caution.

Meaning that I was able to show that based on the data available some properties of airports could be identified having a significant effect on the number of animal strikes, and even for individual flights a prediction can be given for the strike, but there real world is much more complex, than the regressions and predictions build in this pet project.

### Approved Models

As already mentioned in the initial resource plan, this final paper is a pet project, therefore the results of the project will never be put into a real production environment, meaning that no approval is required for any of the models created during the project.
